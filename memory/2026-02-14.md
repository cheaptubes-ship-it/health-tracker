- Fixed OpenClaw Control UI disconnect after browser history cleared: must open tokenized dashboard URL via `openclaw dashboard` to restore gateway token in browser storage.
- Working repo for Health Tracker is `health-tracker-next` (Next.js + Supabase). Dev server runs on http://localhost:3000.
- Memory search (vector) had issues due to OpenAI embeddings quota; attempted config changes. Session history is still available via session logs.

Health Tracker next steps (Mike):
- Verify "date should advance automatically" in the morning; fix if not.
- iPhone Shortcut work still pending (steps import/automation).

Recent shipped fixes:
- Meal-from-photo pipeline now works on iPhone: HEIC→JPEG conversion, client-side downscaling to avoid HTTP 413, clearer errors.
- Summary tab shows "(fasting)" under Food when fasting_active.
- Meal photo AI estimate UI now asks about added oil/dressing and adjusts calories/fat accordingly.
- Peptides trends chart: fixed duplicate series by normalizing names.

Next project (Second Brain):
- Mike wants this built iteratively like Health Tracker (real code, deploy, tweak).
- Existing Notion DBs appear to exist (Notes/Projects/Meetings/Areas/Admin/Ideas/Inbox Log/People). Schema review to do tomorrow.
- Need to inspect Notion via web (Chrome) + OpenClaw Browser Relay attached tab (tomorrow).
- Prefers Slack as capture channel; Zapier account exists (website plugin).
